The highest reward for each party occurs when both parties choose to cooperate. More specifically:\n- If they both betray each other, they get nothing.\n- If one cooperates whereas the other defects, the former get 5 points while the latter get nothing.\n- If they both cooperate, each of them get 3 points.\n\nLet's play now!\n"
